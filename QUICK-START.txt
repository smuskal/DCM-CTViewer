                    CT VIEWER - QUICK START GUIDE
==============================================================================

FIRST: Double-click "START-HERE.html" for visual instructions with links!

==============================================================================
                         HOW IT WORKS
==============================================================================

  THE SOFTWARE (this folder)     YOUR SCAN IMAGES (anywhere else)
  ---------------------------    --------------------------------
  Put this CTViewer-Software     Your CT/MRI files (.dcm, .jpg,
  folder anywhere you like.      .png) stay wherever they are.
  It contains the viewer app.    The viewer doesn't move them.

  WORKFLOW:  Launch Viewer  -->  Pick Scan Folder  -->  View in 3D
             (from here)         (from anywhere)

  The viewer remembers your recent folders for quick access!

==============================================================================
                         THE BASICS
==============================================================================

This software needs Python installed. If you don't have it:

  Mac:     https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-macos11.pkg
  Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-amd64.exe

  Windows users: CHECK "Add python.exe to PATH" during install!

==============================================================================
                     SETUP (after Python is installed)
==============================================================================

MAC:
  Right-click start.sh → Open With → Terminal

  The script will automatically:
  - Create a virtual environment (first time only)
  - Install all required packages
  - Start the viewer and open your browser

  Alternative (if Open With doesn't work):
  1. Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type Terminal)
  2. Type: cd (with a space after it)
  3. Drag this CTViewer folder from Finder into Terminal
  4. Press Enter
  5. Type: bash start.sh

WINDOWS:
  Double-click start.bat (it handles everything automatically)

==============================================================================
                         THEN WHAT?
==============================================================================

1. Browser opens to http://localhost:7002
2. You'll see a FOLDER BROWSER screen
3. Navigate to YOUR SCAN FOLDER by clicking through directories
   - Folders with images are highlighted in GREEN
   - The number of images is shown next to each folder
4. Click "Open This Folder" when you find your scan
5. Wait for the 3D model to build (a loading indicator shows progress)

TIPS:
  - Click ".." to go up to the parent folder
  - Green highlighted folders contain DICOM/JPG/PNG image files
  - Your recent folders are saved for quick access next time

==============================================================================
                      NEXT TIME (after first setup)
==============================================================================

MAC:     Right-click start.sh → Open With → Terminal
WINDOWS: Double-click start.bat

Your recent scan folders will be remembered!
